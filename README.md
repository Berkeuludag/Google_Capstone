### **Case Study Roadmap - Process**

#### **Guiding Questions and Key Tasks**

1. **What tools are you choosing and why?**  
   Given the large size of the Cyclistic dataset (over 5.6 million rows), **R** was chosen for data processing, using libraries such as `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `hms`, and `data.table` to handle, manipulate, and clean the data. R's ability to manage and process large datasets efficiently makes it an ideal tool for this analysis.

2. **How are you combining the data?**  
   Twelve monthly CSV files (August 2020 to July 2021) were loaded into R using the `read_csv()` function. These files were combined into a single dataset (`cyclistic_df`) using the `rbind()` function. After combining the data, the individual monthly data frames were removed to free up memory.

   - **R Code:** Data Loading and Combining  
     This step merges the data into a single table for the entire year, enabling a comprehensive view for analysis.

3. **How do you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze?**  
   Before cleaning, the data was explored to identify inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates.  
   - **Duplicate Check:** No duplicate rows were found after using `distinct()`.  
   - **Missing Data:** 
     - Rows with missing values were identified and removed using `na.omit()`. This included missing values for station names and lat/lng coordinates.
   - **Invalid Data:** Trips with negative or zero duration were identified and removed by filtering out rows where `ride_length <= 0`.
   - **Column Creation for Analysis:**  
     New columns were created to enhance analysis:
     - `ride_length` (in minutes): Calculated as the difference between `ended_at` and `started_at`.
     - `day_of_week`, `month`, `day`, `year`: Extracted from the `started_at` column using the `wday()`, `format()`, and `hour()` functions to help analyze trips by time and date.
     - `season`: Assigned based on the month using the `mutate()` function to categorize trips into Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter.
     - `time_of_day`: Based on the trip's starting hour, categorized into Morning, Afternoon, Evening, or Night.

   - **R Code:** Data Exploration and Cleaning  
     The code verifies that the data is clean by checking for missing or invalid data, removing unnecessary columns (e.g., station IDs), and creating new variables for deeper analysis.

4. **What steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean?**
   - **Data Cleaning:**  
     - Rows with missing values in key columns (`start_station_name`, `end_station_name`, `end_lat`, `end_lng`) were removed.
     - A new column `ride_length` was created to calculate trip duration, and trips shorter than one minute or longer than one day were excluded.
     - Additional columns `day_of_week`, `month`, `season`, and `time_of_day` were added to facilitate time-based analysis.

   **R Code:** Data Cleaning  
   The cleaning process removed 1,375,912 rows due to missing or incorrect data, ensuring the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

5. **How is the data organized and formatted?**
   The cleaned dataset, `cyclistic_date`, contains the following key columns for analysis:
   - `ride_length`: Duration of each trip.
   - `day_of_week`, `month`, `year`, `time_of_day`: Time and date-based insights for understanding usage patterns.
   - `season`: Helps identify seasonal trends in bike usage.
   - `member_casual`: Differentiates between casual riders and annual members.
   - `rideable_type`: Type of bike used, categorized into three types (classic, electric, etc.).

#### **Deliverable: Documentation of Data Cleaning and Manipulation**

To prepare the Cyclistic dataset for analysis, the data was processed and cleaned using **R**. The process involved loading and combining 12 months of CSV data, cleaning missing and invalid data, and creating new columns for trip duration and time-based analysis. The final cleaned dataset was ready for further analysis, with over 1.3 million rows removed due to missing or inconsistent data. This preparation ensured the data was reliable, well-organized, and ready to provide insights into how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

### **Case Study Roadmap - Analyze**

#### **Guiding Questions and Key Tasks**

1. **How is the data organized for analysis?**  
   The dataset (`cyclistic_date`) includes:
   - **Ride Length (`ride_length`)**: Duration of each ride in minutes.
   - **Day of the Week (`day_of_week`)**: Extracted to study ride patterns across different days.
   - **Starting Hour (`hour`)**: Represents the hour when trips start, enabling time-of-day trend analysis.

2. **What trends or relationships did you discover in the data?**

   **Average Ride Length by Day of the Week:**
   - The average ride length shows a clear pattern where rides tend to be longer on weekends compared to weekdays. The data reveals that Sunday has the longest average ride durations, followed closely by Saturday. This indicates that riders may use the service for more leisurely or extended rides over the weekend.
   - During the weekdays, ride durations are generally shorter and more consistent, suggesting that trips during these days are more likely used for shorter activities or commutes.

   **Key Insight:** The data shows a clear distinction between longer rides over the weekend and shorter, more utilitarian rides during the week. This can inform operational decisions, such as increasing bike availability on weekends when rides are longer and may impact turnover.


   **Count of Rides by Starting Hours:**
   - Analyzing the number of rides by starting hours reveals that rides tend to peak at specific times of the day. The highest number of rides occur between 7–9 AM and 5–7 PM, corresponding to traditional commuting hours.
   - There is a noticeable drop in the number of rides during late-night and early morning hours (12 AM to 6 AM), with a steady increase during the day, peaking again around mid-afternoon and evening.

   **Key Insight:** The clear ride peaks during commuting hours suggest that many users rely on the service for transportation to and from work or other routine activities. Meanwhile, the rise in rides during late morning and early afternoon points to increased leisure or non-work-related trips during these times.

   **Visualization:** A bar chart showing the count of rides by starting hour can effectively highlight the daily peaks and patterns.

3. **How do these insights help answer your business question?**  
   These findings show distinct patterns in both ride length and ride times. Longer rides are more common on weekends, and usage peaks during commuting hours, which provides operational insights into when the service is most in demand. Understanding these patterns can help with resource planning (e.g., adjusting bike distribution and availability), as well as future service expansion or marketing focused on maximizing ridership during quieter times.

4. **Were there any surprises in the data?**  
   It was somewhat surprising to see such a sharp increase in ride activity during specific hours (7–9 AM and 5–7 PM), with relatively low ride numbers outside these windows. This insight emphasizes the importance of optimizing bike availability during peak hours.

#### **Deliverable: Summary of Analysis**

The analysis revealed two key trends:
- **Average Ride Length by Day of the Week:** Ride durations are longest on weekends, particularly on Sundays, and shorter during weekdays, suggesting different use cases for the service across these periods.
- **Count of Rides by Starting Hours:** Ride numbers peak during commuting hours (7–9 AM and 5–7 PM), while late mornings and afternoons also see a significant increase, likely due to leisure or flexible travel times.

### **Case Study Roadmap - Act**


#### **Recommendations Based on Analysis**

1. **Optimize bike distribution for commuting hours and weekends:**  
   Ensure a higher supply of bikes at key docking stations during morning and evening commuting hours (7–9 AM and 5–7 PM) on weekdays, as well as during weekends when ride durations are longest.

2. **Leverage off-peak hours with promotions:**  
   Offer promotional pricing or incentives for users to ride during off-peak hours (midday on weekdays) to increase usage when the service is typically underutilized.

3. **Streamline maintenance and restocking schedules:**  
   Conduct bike maintenance and restocking during early morning hours (12 AM to 6 AM), when usage is at its lowest, to ensure bikes are fully operational during high-demand periods.
